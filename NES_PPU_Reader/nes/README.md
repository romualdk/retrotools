# OnaNES (Oh No Another NES Emulator)

_In Javascript !_

This is my implementation of the NES console, which emulates both the original CPU and PPU.

This git repo comes without a frontend as I wanted it to be as bare as possible.
I started implementing a UI using React.js, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fredericcambon/react-nes).

## Getting Started

### Installing

#### Yarn

```shell
yarn install nes-emulator
```

#### NPM

```shell
npm install nes-emulator
```

#### Local

Clone the repo and

```shell
yarn install
yarn run build
```

### How to Use

The library uses an observer pattern to signal events (frames ready, reset, pause ...).

Here's an example of how to use this library.

```
import { Console } from "nes-emulator";

class NES {
    constructor() {
        this.console = new Console();

        // Will notify `this.notify` upon events
        this.console.addObserver( this );

        // Here romData is the content of a .nes ROM
        this.console.loadROM( `romData` );
        this.console.start();
    }

    notify(t, e) {
        switch (t) {
            case 'frame-ready': {
                // Draw the frame using `e` (Uint8Array)
            }
        }
    }

}
```

## Examples

### Sketchfab Viewer API (http://grun7.com/sketchfab-viewer-api-nes/)

![Example1](https://i.imgur.com/Znq5kHSl.png)

This was made only for fun, to show it is possible to make this emulator run and displayed on a 3D model.
It uses Sketchfab and its viewer API.

### Demo with React (https://onanes.herokuapp.com/)

UI using ReactJS

## Features

### Done

- Fully functional CPU
- Functional PPU
- UXROM, NROM, CNROM, MMC1, MMC3 mappers
- Save/Load

### In Progress

- Additional mappers
- Tests

### TODO

The emulator is missing features such as

- Sound
- Make list of playable games

And needs improvement for

- Cycle accurate CPU
- Some PPU glitches

## API Documentation

TODO WIP

### Signals triggered by the Console

#### frame-ready

Fired at a 60 fps rate when a frame is ready, provides
a 256x240x4 byte array containing the RGB colors to display.

#### nes-reset

Fired when a game is loaded and the console restarts.
